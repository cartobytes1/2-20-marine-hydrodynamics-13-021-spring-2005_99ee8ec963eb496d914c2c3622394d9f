Homework Policy
---------------

Homework problems will be assigned after each lecture. Generally, homework will be due one week after it is assigned. However, because of holidays and quizzes there are variations to this rule. The scheduled due dates are given in the course calendar.

Problem Sets
------------

Homework problems are often divided into parts A and B. Generally, Part A is assigned on a Tuesday and Part B is assigned on a Thursday of a given week. Both assignments are then due the following Tuesday (or Wednesday if Tuesday is a holiday). Challenge problems are also assigned, but the completion of these problems is optional and not required.
